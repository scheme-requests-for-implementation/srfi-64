This directory contains an implementation of SRFI 64 provided by
Taylan Kammer.

There are some differences between Per's sample implementation and
Taylan's implementation.  Rather than describing them here, I refer
readers to the [[https://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-64/msg/13288855/][email discussion]] about the new implementation.  Both
Per and Taylan contributed.
