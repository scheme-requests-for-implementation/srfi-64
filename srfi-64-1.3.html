<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
This defines an API for writing <dfn>test suites</dfn>, to make it easy
to portably test Scheme APIs, libaries, applications, and implementations.
A test suite is a collection of <dfn>test cases</dfn> that execute
in the context of a <dfn>test-runner</dfn>.  This specifications
also supports writing new test-runners, to allow customization
of reporting and processing the result of running test suites.</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>
<p>
There are other testing frameworks written in Scheme, including
<a href="http://schematics.sourceforge.net/schemeunit.html">SchemeUnit</a>.
However SchemeUnit is not portable.
It is also a bit on the verbose side.
It would be useful to have a bridge between this framework and SchemeUnit
so SchemeUnit tests could run under this framework and vice versa.
However, that is not part of this specification.</p>
<p>
There exists at least one Scheme wrapper providing a Scheme interface
to the <q>standard</q> <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> API for Java.
It would be useful to have a bridge so that tests written using this
framework can run under a JUnit runner, and also that existing Scheme tests
run under the current framework.
However, that is not part of this specification.</p>
<p>
We should have a testsuite for the testing framework.  It should preferably
be written using this specification, if that isn't too awkward.
At the very least we need complete examples that exercise more of the API.</p>
<p>
The implementation should be ported to other featureful Scheme
implementations so they can make use of other than the lowest
R5RS functionality.</p>
<p>
Need to define <var>error-type</var> for <code>test-error</code>.</p>
<p>
Need to nail down definition of <var>test specifier</var> - 
specifically how a value gets coerced to a specifier procedure.</p>
<p>
The implementation could be polished a bit more.</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>The Scheme community needs a standard for writing test suites.
Every SRFI or other library should come with a test suite.
Such a test suite must be portable, without requiring any
non-standard features, such as modules.  The test suite implementation
or "runner" need not be portable, but it is desirable that it be
possible to write a portable basic implementation.</p>
<p>
This API makes use of implicit dynamic state, including an
implicit <q>test runner</q>.  This makes the API convenient
and terse to use, but it may be a little less elegant and <q>compositional</q>
than using explicit test objects, such as JUnit-style frameworks.
It is not claimed to follow either object-oriented or functional design
principles, but I hope it is useful and convenient to use and extend.</p>
<p>
This proposal allows converting a Scheme source file to a
test suite by just adding a few macros.  You don't have to
write the entire file in a new form, thus you don't have to
re-ident it.</p>
<p>
All names defined by the API start with the prefix <code>test-</code>.
(<b>Issue:</b> Perhaps a colon prefix <code>test:</code> or
<code>testing:</code> would be better.)
All function-like forms are defined as syntax.  They may be implemented
as functions or macros or builtins.  The reason for specifying them as
syntax is to allow specific tests to be skipped without evaluating sub-expressions, or for implementations
to add features such as printing line numbers or catching exceptions.</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>Let's start with a simple example.
This is a complete self-contained test-suite.</p>

<pre>
;; Initialize and give a name to a simple testsuite.
(test-begin "vec-test")
(define v (make-vector 5 99))
;; Require that an expression evaluate to true.
(test-assert (vector? v))
;; Test that an expression is eqv? to some other expression.
(test-eqv (vector-ref v 2) 99)
(vector-set! v 2 7)
(test-eqv (vector-ref v 2) 7)
;; Finish the testsuite, and report results.
(test-end "vec-test")
</pre>
<p>
This testsuite could be saved in its own source file.
Nothing else is needed:
We do not require any top-level forms, so it is easy
to wrap an existing program or test to this form, without adding indentation.
It is also easy to add new tests, without having to name individual
tests (though that is optional).</p>
<p>
Test cases are executed in the context of a <dfn>test runner</dfn>,
which is a object that accumulates and reports test results.
This specification defines how to create and use custom test runners,
but implementations should also provide a default test runner.
It is suggested (but not required) that loading the above
file in a top-level environment will cause the
tests to be executed using an implementation-specified default test runner,
and <code>test-end</code> will cause a summary to be displayed
in an implementation-specified manner.</p>

<h2>Simple test-cases</h2>
<p>
Primitive test cases test that a given condition is true.
They may have a name.
The core test case form is <code>test-assert</code>:</p>
<pre>
(test-assert [<var>test-name</var>] <var>expression</var>)
</pre>
<p>
This evaluates the <var>expression</var>.
The test passes if the result
is true; if the result is false, a test failure is reported.
The test also fails if an exception is raised, assuming the implementation
has a way to catch exceptions.
How the failure is reported depends on the test runner environment.
The <var>test-name</var> is a string that names the test case.
It is used when reporting errors, and also when skipping tests,
as described below.
It is an error to invoke <code>test-assert</code>
if there is no current test runner.</p>
<p>
The following forms may be more convenient than
using <code>test-assert</code> directly:</p>
<pre>
(test-eqv [<var>test-name</var>] <var>test-expr</var> <var>expected</var>)
</pre>
<p>
This is equivalent to:</p>
<pre>
(test-assert [<var>test-name</var>] (eqv? <var>test-expr</var> <var>expected</var>))
</pre>
<p>
Similarly <code>test-equal</code> and <code>test-eq</code>
are shorthand for <code>test-assert</code> combined with
<code>equal?</code> or <code>eq?</code>, respectively.</p>
<p>
Here is a simple example:</p>
<pre>
(define (mean x y) (/ (+ x y) 2.0))
(test-eqv (mean 3 5) 4)
</pre>

<h2>Tests for catching errors</h2>
<p>
We need a way to specify that evaluation <em>should</em> fail.
This are tests that errors are detected.</p>
<pre>
(test-error [[<var>test-name</var>] <var>error-type</var>] <var>test-expr</var>)
</pre>
<p>
Evaluating <var>test-expr</var> is expected to signal an error.
The kind of error is indicated by  <var>error-type</var>.</p>
<p><b>Issue:</b> What is <var>error-type</var>?  Perhaps a
<dfn>condition type</dfn> or the associated predicate,
in the SRFI-35 sense?</p>
<p>
If the <var>error-type</var> is left out, or it is
<code>#t</code>, it means "some kind of unspecified error should be signaled".
For example:</p>
<pre>
(test-error #t (vector-ref #(1 2) 9))
</pre>
<p>
An implementation that cannot catch exceptions should skip
<code>test-error</code> forms.</p>

<h2>Test groups and paths</h2>
<p>A <dfn>test group</dfn> is a named sequence of forms containing testcases,
expressions, and definitions.
Entering a group sets the <dfn>test group name</dfn>; leaving a
group restores the previous group name.
These are dynamic (run-time) operations, and a group has no
other effect or identity.
Test groups are informal groupings: they are neither
Scheme values, nor are they syntactic forms.</p>
<!--(More formal <q>test suite</q> values are introduced below.)-->
<p>
A test group may contain nested inner test groups.
The <dfn>test group path</dfn> is a list of the currently-active
(entered) test group names, oldest (outermost) first.</p>
<pre>
(test-begin <var>suite-name</var>)
</pre>
<p>A <code>test-begin</code> enters a new test group.
The <var>suite-name</var> becomes the current test group name,
and is added to the end of the test group path.
Portable test suites should use a sting literal for <var>suite-name</var>;
the effect of expressions or other kinds of literals is unspecified.</p>
<p>
<b>Rationale:</b> In some ways using symbols would be preferable.
However, we want human-readable names, and standard Scheme does not
provide a way to include spaces or mixed-case text in
literal symbols.</p>
<p>
Additionally, if there is no currently executing test runner,
one is installed in an implementation-defined manner.</p>
<pre>
(test-end [<var>suite-name</var>] [<var>count</var>])
</pre>
<p>
A <code>test-end</code> leaves the current test group.
An error is reported if the <var>suite-name</var> does not
match the current test group name.  If it does match an earlier
name in the test group path, intervening groups are left.</p>
<p>
The optional <var>count</var> must match the number of
test-cases executed since the matching <code>test-begin</code>.
(Nested test groups count as a single test case for this count.)
This extra test may be useful to catch cases where a test doesn't
get executed because of some unexpected error.</p>
<p>
Additionally, if the matching <code>test-begin</code>
installed a new test-runner, then the <code>test-end</code>
will de-install it, after reporting the accumulated test
results in an implementation-defined manner.</p>

<pre>
(test-group <var>suite-name</var> <var>decl-or-expr</var> ...)
</pre>
<p>
Equivalent to:</p>
<pre>
(if (not (test-to-skip% <var>suite-name</var>))
  (dynamic-wind
    (lambda () (test-begin <var>suite-name</var>))
    (lambda () <var>decl-or-expr</var> ...)
    (lambda () (test-end <var>suite-name</var>))))
</pre>
<p>This is usually equivalent to executing the <var>decl-or-expr</var>s
within the named test group.  However, the entire group is skipped
if it matched an active <code>test-skip</code> (see later).
Also, the <code>test-end</code> is executed in case of an exception.</p>
<p><b>Issue:</b> In the case of an exception, should we actually catch it,
and proceed following the <code>test-group</code>, or should we
use a separate form for catching errors?</p>

<h2>Handling set-up and cleanup</h2>
<pre>
(test-group-with-cleanup <var>suite-name</var>
  <var>decl-or-expr</var> ...
  <var>cleanup-form</var>)
</pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
(test-group-with-cleanup "test-file"
  (define f (open-output-file "log"))
  (do-a-bunch-of-tests f)
  (close-output-port f))
</pre>

<!--
<h2>Test suites</h2>
<p>
<i>(Not sure how useful this is, given <code>test-group</code>).</i>
<p>A <dfn>test suite</dfn> is a test group that can (and must) be
executed explicitly.
<pre>
(test-suite <var>suite-name</var> <var>decl-or-expr</var> ...)
</pre>
<p>
The <df>test suite path</dfn> is the list of names of currently
running testsuites, from outermost (oldest) to innermost (newest).
<p>A <code>test-suite</code> form is equivalent to:
<pre>
(test-suite-register <var>suite-name</var>
  (test-group <var>suite-name</var> <var>decl-or-expr</var> ...))
</pre>
You can run previously registered test suite:
<pre>
(test-suite-run <var>suite-name</var>)
</pre>
<p>
<b>Issues:</b> Is a <var>suite-name</var> a string (compatible with
test groups), a quoted symbol, or an identifier?
I.e. should the <code>test-suite</code> be a declaration
of <var>suite-name</var> in the current lexical/top-level environment?
Should a test suite be just a procedure, and <code>test-suite-run</code>
just be <code>apply</code>?
-->

<h2>Test specifiers</h2>
<p>Sometimes we want to only run certain tests, or we know that
certain tests are expected to fail.
A <dfn>test specifier</dfn> is one-argument function that takes a test-runner
and returns a boolean.  The specifier may be run before a test is performed,
and the result may control whether the test is executed.
For convenience, a specifier may also be a non-procedure value,
which is coerced to a specifier procedure <em>as needs to be decided</em>.</p>
<p>
<code>(test-match-named <var>name</var>)</code><br />
The resulting specifier matches if the current test name (as
returned by <code>test-runnner-test-name</code>) is <code>equals?</code> to
<var>name</var>.</p>
<p>
<code>(test-match-nth <var>n</var> [<var>count</var>])</code><br/>
This evaluates to a <em>stateful</em> predicate: A counter keeps track of
how many times it has been called.
The predicate matches the <var>n</var>'th time it is called
(where <code>1</code> is the first time), and
the next <code>(- <var>count</var> 1)</code> times,
where <var>count</var> defaults to <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>
<code>(test-match-any <var>specifier</var> ...)</code><br />
The resulting specifier matches if any <var>specifier</var>
matches.</p>
<p>
<code>(test-match-all <var>specifier</var> ...)</code><br />
The resulting specifier matches if each <var>specifier</var>
matches.</p>

<h2>Skipping selected tests</h2>
<p>In some cases you may want to skip a test.</p>
<pre>
(test-skip <var>specifier</var>)
</pre>
<p>Evaluatng <code>test-skip</code> adds the
resulting <var>specifier</var>
to the set of currently active skip-specifiers.
Before each test (or <code>begin-group</code>)
the set of active skip-specifiers are applied to the active test-runner.
If any specifier matches, then the test is skipped.</p>
<p>
For convenience, if the <var>specifier</var> is a string that
is syntactic sugar for <code>(test-match-named <var>specifier</var>)</code>.
For example:</p>
<pre>
(test-skip "test-b")
(test-assert "test-a")   ;; executed
(test-assert "test-b")   ;; skipped
</pre>
<!--
<pre>
(test-skip [<var>relative-path</var>] [<var>test-name</var>] [<var>offset</var> [<var>count</var>]])
</pre>
<p>
This causes matching tests (following the call to <code>test-skip</code>
until the end of the current test group) are to be skipped.
All parameters are optional, though at least one part must be
present.
<p>
The <var>relative-path</var> must be a list, and if it is missing
defaults to the empty list.
The current group path (when the <code>test-skip</code> is evaluated) and the
<var>relative-path</var> are appended to yield a <var>specifier-path</var>.
A test case is skipped if the <var>specifier-path</var> is an
initial sub-list of the group path when executing the test.
<p>
For example to skip the remaining tests in the current group do:</p>
<pre>
(test-skip '())
</pre>
<p>
You might want to do so only if an error has been seen:</p>
<pre>
(if (positive? (test-error-count))
  (test-skip '()))
</pre>
<p>
Another example:</p>
<pre>
(test-skip '("group1"))
(test-assert 'test-01 #t) ;; Executed
(test-begin "group1")
(test-assert 'test-1-1 #t) ;; skipped
(test-end "group1")
</pre>
<p>
The <var>test-name</var> if present must be a string.
If it is present and neither <var>offset</var> nor <var>count</var>
are present, then the
specifier matches only named test cases with the same
<var>test-name</var> (as compared with <code>equal?</code>).
For example:</p>
<pre>
(test-skip "test2")
(test-assert "test1" #t) ;; Not skipped
(test-assert "test2" #t) ;; Skipped
(test-assert "test3" #t) ;; Not skipped
</pre>
<p>
If <var>offset</var> is present, it must be an exact integer,
and the specifier instead matches the <var>offset</var>'th test case
following the one with <var>test-name</var> and in the same test group.
(Nested test groups count as one compond test case.)
If <var>count</var> is specified, it must be an exact integer;
otherwise it defaults to <code>1</code>.
It specifies the number of consecutive test cases that match.
Some examples:</p>
<pre>
(test-skip "test1" 2)
(test-skip "test5" 0 2)
(test-assert "test1" #t) ;; Not skipped
(test-assert "test2" #t) ;; Not skipped
(test-assert "test3" #t) ;; Skipped - 2nd after "test2"
(test-assert "test4" #t) ;; Not skipped
(test-assert "test5" #t) ;; Skipped
(test-assert "test6" #t) ;; Skipped
(test-assert "test7" #t) ;; Not skipped
</pre>
<p>
If <var>test-name</var> is missing and <var>offset</var> specified,
then the <var>offset</var> is relative to the next test-case
(named or unnamed) in the specied group,
relative to when the specifier is evaluated.
If the <var>relative-path</var> is empty, then an <var>offset</var>
or <code>0</code> refers to the test case-case, and so on.
Otherwise, the effect is as if the <code>test-skip</code>
were deferred to the next <code>test-begin</code>
matching the <var>specifier-path</var>.  An example:</p>
<pre>
(test-skip 1 2)
(test-assert #t) ;; Not skipped
(test-assert #t) ;; Skipped
(test-assert #t) ;; Skipped
</pre>
-->
<p>
Any skip specifiers introduced by a <code>test-skip</code>
are removed by a following non-nested <code>test-end</code>.</p>
<pre>
(test-begin "group1")
(test-skip "test-a")
(test-assert "test-a")   ;; skipped
(test-end "group1)       ;; Undoes the prior test-skip
(test-assert "test-a")   ;; executed
</pre>

<h2>Expected failures</h2>
<p>
Sometimes you know a test case will fail, but you don't have time
to or can't fix it.   Maybe a certain feature only works on certain platforms.
However, you want the test-case to be there
to remind you to fix it.  You want to note that 
such tests are expected to fail.</p>
<pre>
(test-expect-fail <var>specifier</var>)
</pre>
<p>
Matching tests (where matching is defined as in <code>test-skip</code>)
are expected to fail.  This only affects test reporting,
not test execution.</p>

<h2>Test-runner</h2>
<p>
A <dfn>test-runner</dfn> is an object that runs a test-suite,
and manages the state.  The test group path, and the sets skip and
expected-fail specifiers are part of the test-runner.
A test-runner will also typically accumulate statistics about executed tests,
</p>
<p>
<code>(test-runner-current)</code><br />
<code>(test-runner-current <var>runner</var>)</code><br />
Get or set the current test-runner.
If an implementation supports parameter objects
(as in <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-39/srfi-39.html">SRFI-39</a>),
then <code>test-runner-current</code> can be a parameter object.
Alternatively, <code>test-runner-current</code> may be implemented
as a macro or function 
that uses a fluid or thread-local variable, or a plain global variable.</p>
<p>
<code>(test-runner-simple)</code><br />
Creates a new simple test-runner, that prints errors and a summary
on the standard output port.</p>
<p>
<code>(test-runner-null)</code><br />
Creates a new test-runner, that does nothing with the test results.
This is mainly meant for extending when writing a custom runner.</p>
<p>
Implementations <em>may</em> provide other test-runners, perhaps
a <code>(test-runner-gui)</code>.</p>
<p><code>(test-runner-create)</code><br />
Create a new test-runner.  Equivalent to
<code>((test-runner-factory))</code>.</p>
<p>
<code>(test-runner-factory)</code><br/>
<code>(test-runner-factory <var>factory</var>)</code><br/>
Get or set the current test-runner factory.
A factory is a zero-argument function that creates a new test-runner.
The default value is <code>test-runner-simple</code>,
but implementations may provide a way to override the default.
As with <code>test-runner-current</code>, this may be a parameter object,
or use a per-thread, fluid, or global variable.</p>

<h2>Running specific tests with a specified runner</h2>
<pre>
(test-apply [<var>runner</var>] <var>specifier</var> ... <var>procedure</var>)
</pre>
<p>
Calls <var>procedure</var> with no arguments using the specified
<var>runner</var> as the current test-runner.
If <var>runner</var> is omitted,
then <code>(test-runner-current)</code> is used.
(If there is no current runner, one is created as in <code>test-begin</code>.)
If one or more <var>specifier</var>s are listed then only tests matching
the <var>specifier</var>s are executed.  A <var>specifier</var> has the same form
as one used for <code>test-skip</code>.  A test is executed
if it matches any of the <var>specifier</var>s in the
<code>test-apply</code> <em>and</em> does not match any
active <code>test-skip</code> specifiers.</p>
<pre>
(test-with-runner <var>runner</var> <var>decl-or-expr</var> ...)
</pre>
<p>
Executes each <var>decl-or-expr</var> in order in a context
where the current test-runner is <var>runner</var>.</p>

<h2>Writing a new test-runner</h2>
<p>This section can be ignored if you just want to write test-cases.</p>

<h3>Test result</h3>
<p>A test-result is an association list
that contains various information about the result of a test.
Some associations are standard; implementations can add more.</p>
<p>The <code>test-kind</code> association return one of the following symbols:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>'PASS</code></dt><dd>The passed, as expected.</dd>
<dt><code>'FAIL</code></dt><dd>The test failed (and was not expected to).</dd>
<dt><code>'XFAIL</code></dt><dd>The test failed and was expected to.</dd>
<dt><code>'XPASS</code></dt><dd>The test passed, but was expected to fail.</dd>
<dt><code>'SKIP</code></dt><dd>The test was skipped.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
If an impementation can pass the source location (filename and line)
to the test routines, they should use the associations <code>source-file</code>
and <code>source-line</code>.</p>
<p><em>Examples needed.</em>  Also more standard associations.</p>

<h3>Test-runner components</h3>
<p>
The following functions are for accessing the components of a test-runner.
They would normally only be used to write a new test-runner or
a match-predicate.</p>
<p>
<code>(test-runner-pass-count <var>runner</var>)</code><br />
Returns the number of tests that passed, and were expected to pass.</p>
<p>
<code>(test-runner-fail-count <var>runner</var>)</code><br />
Returns the number of tests that failed, but were expected to pass.</p>
<p>
<code>(test-runner-xpass-count <var>runner</var>)</code><br />
Returns the number of tests that passed, but were expected to fail.</p>
<p>
<code>(test-runner-xfail-count <var>runner</var>)</code><br />
Returns the number of tests that failed, and were expected to pass.</p>
<p>
<code>(test-runner-skip-count <var>runner</var>)</code><br />
Returns the number of tests or test groups that were skipped.</p>
<p>
<code>(test-runnner-test-name <var>runner</var>)</code><br />
Returns the name of the current test or test group, as a string.
During execution of <code>test-begin</code> this is the name of the
test group; during the execution of an actual test, this is the name
of the test-case.
If no name was specified, the name is the empty string.</p>
<p>
<code>(test-runner-aux-value <var>runner</var>)</code><br />
<code>(test-runner-aux-value! <var>runner</var> <var>on-test</var>)</code><br />
Get or set the <code>aux-value</code> field of a test-runner.
This field is not used by this API or the <code>test-runner-simple</code>
test-runner, but may be used by custom test-runners to store extra state.</p>
<p>
<code>(test-runner-on-test <var>runner</var>)</code><br />
<code>(test-runner-on-test! <var>runner</var> <var>on-test</var>)</code><br />
Gets or sets the procedure that is run after each test to report
the results.  The procedure takes two parameters: a test-runner,
and an association list giving information about the test.
(<em>Need more specifics on this!</em>)
Typically, this procedure may be emit terse or no output if the test succeeded
or was skipped, and emit more detailed output if the test failed.
The initial value is <code>test-on-test-simple</code> which writes
to the standard output (<em>fill this in later</em>).</p>
<p>
<code>(test-runner-on-final <var>runner</var>)</code><br />
<code>(test-runner-on-final! <var>runner</var> <var>on-final</var>)</code><br />
Gets or sets the procedure that is run at the very end to report
the results.  The procedure takes one parameter (a test-runner)
and typically displays a summary (count) of the tests.
The initial value is <code>test-on-final-simple</code> which writes
to the standard output port the rumber of tests of the various kinds.</p>
<p>
<code>(test-runner-reset <var>runner</var>)</code><br />
Resets the state of the <var>runner</var> to its initial state.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>This is an example of a simple custom test-runner.
Loading this program before running a test-suite will install
it as the default test runner.</p>
<pre>
(define (my-simple-runner filename)
  (let ((runner (test-runner-null))
	(port (open-output-file filename))
        (num-passed 0)
        (num-failed 0))
    (test-runner-on-test! runner
      (lambda (runner result)
        (case (cdr (assq 'result-kind result))
          ((pass xpass) (set! num-passed (+ num-passed 1)))
          ((fail xfail) (set! num-failed (+ num-failed 1)))
          (else #t))))
    (test-runner-on-final! runner
       (lambda (runner)
          (format port "Passing tests: ~d.~%Failing tests: ~d.~%"
                  num-passed num-failed)
	  (close-output-port port)))
    runner))

(test-runner-factory
 (lambda () (my-simple-runner "/tmp/my-test.log")))
</pre>

<h1>Implementation</h1>
<p>
The test implementation uses <code>cond-expand</code>
(<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-0/srfi-0.html">SRFI-0</a>)
to select different code depending on certain SRFI names (<code>srfi-9</code>,
<code>srfi-34</code>, <code>srfi-35</code>, <code>srfi-39</code>),
or implementations (<code>kawa</code>).
It should otherwise be portable to any R5RS implementation.
(It has been tested on Kawa, MzScheme, and Chez Scheme.
So far only Kawa makes use of non-R5RS features; patches welcomed.)</p>
<p>
The implementation is neither finished nor debugged,
but I hope ready for people to experiment with.</p>

<h2>Test suite</h2>
<p>
Of course we need a test suite for the testing framework testself.
For that we need a meta-lever test-runner.
The <code>test-with-runner</code> should be helpful.</p>
